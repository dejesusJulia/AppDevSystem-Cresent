# CRESENT: Building Brighter Connections
Cresent is a website that helps people take their first step on building their own professional team. Essentially, it serves as a bridge for individuals who want to start their own company. They can upload their credentials for other people to see then establish a connection to whomever they like. 

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The database of this system six main tables:
- three parent tables (**Positions**, **Subjects**, and **Teams**);
- one parent && child (Users table is the parent of Connections table and Categories table);
- and two bridge tables (**Connections table** links two users, while **Categories table** is a bridge for the many-to-many relationship of **Users table** and **Subjects table**)

The other tables are provided by Laravel when the tables are migrated

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
